        <h3>CZM Appeal</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">Although institutionalizing Zakat management is a difficult but noble task, its success depends on our collective efforts. Combating the disappointing poverty scenario cannot be only an individual responsibility. Combined effort and planned action is needed to bring changes to this scenario.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">We invite and encourage all willing Muslims to come forward and work in a united  platform like CZM for institutionalizing Zakat management and make a lasting difference in the lives of the impoverished people of our society.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
        Let us stand beside the distressed people and try to feel their agony and miseries and take sincere efforts to emancipate them from the curse of poverty. If an innocent poor child can learn, or a student can build up his career, or a girl becomes a good mother, or a poor family can get rid of poverty out of your Zakat money, it will bring plenty of pleasure and happiness for you and you may also expect proper reward in the eternal life by Allah SWT.
